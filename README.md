**Game_of_life**

A simulation of Conway's game of life. A GUI software developped using Java and its Swing and AWT packages.

Conway's game of life is a zero player game (meaning that we only give it some input. It evolves based on that input and the rules of the game). It has 4 simple rules. The game of life is of great interest for the scientific community and particularly mathematicians because of the unimaginable complexity it exhibits based on those 4 simple rules. It resembles our universe because we also observe very complex phenomena in the usiverse all governed by not so many scientific laws and principles.

Java source codes and compiled bitecodes of the software can be found in this repository. Anyone interested in running the software (the simulation) needs to compile the sourse code or use the already compiled bitecode. I compiled the source code using JDK 11.

This specific application has two option for the user to pick. Random mode and Custom create mode.
     The first one is to generate a random cells while the other is to populate the cells based on the user's preference. It also gives the user an option to choose the number of cells at the start of the application.
